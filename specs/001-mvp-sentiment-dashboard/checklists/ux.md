## Summary

**Total Items**: 75 requirement quality checks  
**Categories**: 12 (Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Measurability, Coverage, Accessibility, Responsive, Performance, Edge Cases, Playful Design, Traceability)  
**Primary Gaps Identified**:

- Visual design specifications (size, color, positioning)
- "Playful manner" operationalization (FR-011 ambiguity)
- Accessibility requirements (ARIA, keyboard, screen reader)
- Responsive design breakpoints and mobile requirements
- Loading/error state visual specifications
- Micro-interactions and animation requirements

**Critical Ambiguities to Resolve**:

- FR-011: "Visually engaging and playful manner" lacks measurable criteria
- SC-003: "90% of visitors can correctly identify" lacks testing methodology
- US1: "Clear visual indicator" not quantified with specific properties
- US1: Emoji examples ("happy/neutral/sad") - binding or illustrative?

**Recommendation**: Address CHK017, CHK018, CHK065-CHK069 before Phase 3 implementation to ensure consistent playful design interpretation across team.
