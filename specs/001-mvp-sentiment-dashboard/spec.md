# Feature Specification: MVP Sentiment Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-mvp-sentiment-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A playful web app that visualizes how the Netherlands feels about healthcare insurance in real-time what: Zorg-sentiment collects and analyzes public conversations about Dutch healthcare insurance from social media and news sources. It translates this data into an interactive 'national mood' indicator. The goal is to make the serious world of healthcare insurance more engaging and human through humor, data, and visual storytelling. why: Healthcare insurance is a serious, data-heavy topic that often feels distant from people's emotions. Zorg-sentiment bridges that gap by using real-world data to reflect the collective public mood ‚Äî turning dry sentiment into something visual, relatable, and fun. This app demonstrates how multiple open APIs can combine to create engaging insights from complex, regulated domains."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-24

- Q: How should sentiment scores be classified into positive, neutral, and negative categories? ‚Üí A: Three-way threshold: ‚â•60% positive = positive mood, ‚â•60% negative = negative mood, otherwise mixed/neutral
- Q: How often should the system collect new sentiment data from sources? ‚Üí A: Hourly: Fresh data throughout the day while managing API rate limits and processing costs
- Q: What is the expected concurrent user capacity for the MVP? ‚Üí A: 100-500 concurrent users: Small audience, minimal infrastructure, lowest cost
- Q: How old can displayed sentiment data be before the app should show a prominent "data may be outdated" warning? ‚Üí A: 24 hours: Reasonable grace period, aligns with daily minimum update expectation
- Q: What rate limiting should be applied to protect against abuse? ‚Üí A: Strict IP limits: 20 requests/hour per IP, very restrictive, may impact legitimate users on shared IPs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Current National Mood (Priority: P1)

A visitor opens the web app to see how people in the Netherlands are currently feeling about healthcare insurance. They see a clear visual indicator showing the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) along with a simple, playful summary.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - showing the "pulse" of Dutch healthcare sentiment. Without this, there is no product. It's the most basic form of value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage and verifying that a sentiment indicator displays with current data. Delivers immediate value by answering "How do people feel about healthcare insurance right now?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app has collected sentiment data, **When** a visitor opens the homepage, **Then** they see a visual mood indicator (e.g., happy/neutral/sad) showing the current sentiment
2. **Given** the visitor views the homepage, **When** they read the summary text, **Then** they see a concise, human-readable description of the current mood (e.g., "The Netherlands is feeling cautiously optimistic about healthcare")
3. **Given** no data is available, **When** a visitor opens the homepage, **Then** they see a friendly message explaining data is being collected

---

### User Story 2 - See Sentiment Trends Over Time (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to understand how sentiment has changed over recent days or weeks. They view a simple chart or timeline showing whether sentiment is improving, declining, or staying stable.

**Why this priority**: This adds context and makes the data more meaningful. Users can see patterns and trends, not just a snapshot. This is the next logical step after seeing current mood.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the trends visualization and verifying it shows historical data points. Delivers value by revealing sentiment patterns over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app has at least 7 days of sentiment data, **When** a visitor views the trends section, **Then** they see a visual representation of sentiment changes over the past week
2. **Given** the visitor hovers over or taps a data point, **When** they interact with the trend chart, **Then** they see the sentiment value and date for that point
3. **Given** sentiment has changed significantly, **When** the visitor views trends, **Then** notable changes are visually highlighted or called out

### User Story 3 - Understand Sentiment Breakdown (Priority: P3) ‚Üí **MERGED INTO US1**

~~A curious visitor wants to see more detail behind the overall mood. They view a breakdown showing the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.~~

**DESIGN CHANGE (2025-10-25)**: Sentiment breakdown percentages are now integrated directly into the MoodIndicator component (User Story 1) to avoid UI duplication and reduce MVP complexity. The breakdown is displayed below the emoji and summary text as color-coded percentage badges within the same component.

**Why this change**: During implementation, we discovered that showing breakdown percentages in a separate component (doughnut chart) created information duplication - the same percentages were already shown in MoodIndicator. For MVP simplicity, we consolidated the breakdown display into a single location.

**Implementation**: Breakdown percentages (positive/neutral/negative) are displayed within `MoodIndicator.vue` component using the existing `showBreakdown` prop, eliminating the need for a separate `SentimentBreakdown.vue` component. All acceptance scenarios below are fulfilled by the integrated display.

**Original Acceptance Scenarios** (now part of User Story 1):

1. ~~**Given** the app has sentiment data, **When** a visitor views the breakdown section, **Then** they see percentages or proportions for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment~~
   ‚Üí **Now fulfilled by**: MoodIndicator component displays percentages when `showBreakdown={true}`
2. ~~**Given** the breakdown is displayed, **When** a visitor views the visualization, **Then** the three categories are clearly distinguished by color or labeling~~
   ‚Üí **Now fulfilled by**: Color-coded badges (green/gray/red per VD-003) distinguish categories in MoodIndicator
3. ~~**Given** one sentiment category dominates (e.g., >70%), **When** the visitor views the breakdown, **Then** this dominance is visually apparent~~
   ‚Üí **Now fulfilled by**: Dominant percentages can be emphasized with bold styling in MoodIndicator

### Edge Cases

- What happens when data collection is temporarily unavailable (API downtime, rate limits)? Display last known data with timestamp; show warning if data is older than 24 hours
- How does the system handle the first day when historical data doesn't exist yet? Show current sentiment only; display message that trend history is building
- What if sentiment data shows extreme values (100% negative or positive)? Display actual values; system accepts full spectrum of sentiment distributions
- How should the app behave if a visitor accesses it in a non-Dutch language browser? Display Dutch content regardless (single language for MVP)
- What happens when there's a data gap in the timeline (missing days)? Display available data points with gaps clearly indicated on trend visualization
