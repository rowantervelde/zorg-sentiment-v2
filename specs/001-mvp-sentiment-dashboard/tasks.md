# Tasks: MVP Sentiment Dashboard

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mvp-sentiment-dashboard/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/sentiment-api.yaml

**Tests**: No explicit test requirements in specification - tests are OPTIONAL for this MVP

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure (Nuxt 4.1.3 with `app/` directory + Netlify Functions):

- Frontend: `app/pages/`, `app/components/`, `app/composables/`
- Backend: `netlify/functions/`, `app/server/api/`, `app/server/utils/`
- Types: `app/types/`
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/e2e/`
- Root: `app/app.vue` (main app component)

---

**Acceptance**:

- Visual mood indicator (happy/neutral/sad emoji/icon) showing current sentiment
- Concise Dutch summary (e.g., "Nederland voelt zich optimistisch over zorg")
- Friendly message when no data available

### Implementation for User Story 1

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - visitors see current mood indicator with summary or friendly no-data message

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - See Sentiment Trends Over Time (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Display 7-day historical trend chart showing sentiment changes

**Independent Test**: View trends visualization and verify it shows historical data points over 7 days. Notable changes are highlighted.

**Acceptance**:

- [ ] T042 [US2] Style TrendChart with Nuxt UI v4 theming and ensure mobile responsiveness

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - visitors see current mood AND historical trends

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Understand Sentiment Breakdown (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Display breakdown showing proportion of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment

**Independent Test**: View sentiment breakdown visualization and verify percentages add up to 100%. Categories clearly distinguished by color.

**Acceptance**:

- Percentages/proportions for positive, neutral, negative sentiment
- Three categories clearly distinguished by color or labeling
- Visual emphasis when one category dominates (>70%)

### Implementation for User Story 3

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Data Collection (Phase 6)**: Can proceed in parallel with Phase 5 (US3)
- **API Completeness (Phase 7)**: Can proceed in parallel with Phase 5 (US3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories (P1-P3) being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1, but integrates with same page
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2, but integrates with same page

### Within Each User Story

- US1: Component creation [P] ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Styling
- US2: Component [P] + Service calculation ‚Üí Chart config ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Styling
- US3: Component [P] ‚Üí Chart config ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Styling

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T007, T008 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- T012, T013, T015, T016, T020, T021 can run in parallel (different files)
- T014 must complete before T018, T019

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T023, T024 can run in parallel (different components)

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T033, T034 can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T043 is the main component (others depend on it)

**Phase 6 (Data Collection)**: T053, T054, T056, T057, T059, T060 can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (API)**: T061, T062, T064, T065, T067 can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: T068, T069, T071, T073, T074, T077, T079, T081 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch components together:
- T023: Create MoodIndicator.vue
- T024: Create DataTimestamp.vue

# These complete before integration:
- T025-T032 run sequentially with dependencies
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Core types and services (parallel):
- T012: types/sentiment.ts
- T013: types/api.ts
- T015: services/rss-fetcher.ts
- T016: services/sentiment-analyzer.ts
- T021: composables/useSentiment.ts

# Data store (blocking):
- T014: services/data-store.ts (MUST complete first)

# Functions (after data-store):
- T018: netlify/functions/collect-sentiment.ts
- T019: server/api/sentiment.get.ts
- T020: Rate limiting edge function
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies within phase
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Netlify Blobs requires deployment to Netlify (local dev uses mock or `netlify dev`)
- All Dutch language content should be grammatically correct and culturally appropriate
- Performance goal: <3s page load (test with Lighthouse after T072)
- Rate limiting: 20 requests/hour per IP (test after T078)
- Data retention: 7 days rolling window (168 hourly data points max)

---

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Start here for fastest time-to-value**:

- Phase 1: Setup (T001-T010)
- Phase 2: Foundational (T011-T022) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- Phase 3: User Story 1 only (T023-T032) üéØ MVP

**Why this is a complete MVP**:

- Delivers core value: "How does Netherlands feel about healthcare insurance RIGHT NOW?"
- Independently testable and deployable
- Requires ~16 hours (2 days) for single developer
- Can validate with real users before building US2/US3
- Constitutional compliance: MVP-first development principle satisfied

**After MVP validation with users, proceed to**:

- Phase 4: User Story 2 (adds trends context)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (adds transparency via breakdown)
- Phase 6-8: Production hardening
