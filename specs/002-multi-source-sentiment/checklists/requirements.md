# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Source Sentiment Data Collection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS

- Specification focuses on WHAT (multi-source collection, source tracking) not HOW
- Business value is clear: improved sentiment accuracy through diverse sources
- Written in plain language suitable for product owners and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS

- All functional requirements are testable (e.g., "at least 4 distinct RSS feeds", "72 hours of consecutive failures")
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "no single source contributing more than 60%", "95% duplicate detection rate")
- Edge cases cover important scenarios (duplicates, source failures, volume imbalance, format variations)
- Scope clearly defines what's included (5 RSS feeds, deduplication, source tracking) and excluded (social media integration, admin UI, ML-based deduplication)
- Assumptions documented (free RSS access, standard XML formats, Dutch language dominance)

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS

- User Story 1 (P1) directly maps to core requirement of collecting from multiple sources
- User Story 2 (P2) addresses "know which resources are used and how much they add"
- User Story 3 (P3) enables operational flexibility
- User Story 4 (P4) prepares for future social media sources as requested
- All stories have clear acceptance scenarios that validate functional requirements
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 provide measurable validation of all key requirements

## Conclusion

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.plan` command. No clarifications or updates needed.
